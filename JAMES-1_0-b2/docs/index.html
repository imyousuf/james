<h3>What is it?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>  The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure 
  Java server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution
  based on currently available open protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Development Status</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>  Current release is under beta test. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Current Features</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are some of the currently implemented features:
    <ul>
    <li>complete portability:  Apache James is be a 100% pure Java application
       based on the Java 2 platform and on top of JavaMail extentions.</li>
    <li>protocol abstraction:  unlike other mail engines, protocols are seen only
       like "communication languages" ruling comunications between clients and
       the server. Apache James is not be tied to any particular protocol but
       follow an abstracted server design (almost like JavaMail did on the
       client side)</li>
    <li>complete solution:  the mail system is able to handle both mail
       transport and storage in a single server application. Apache James
       works alone without the need or any other server or solution.</li>
    <li>servlet support:  Apache James supports MailServlet. This easy-to-write 
       easy-to-use pattern allow to build powerful mail system. Example can be a 
       mailet to send mails as fax or voice, filter mailets, translator,
       mailling list, newspaper via mail etc.</li>
    <li>resource abstraction:  like protocols, resources are abstracted and,
       working through defined interfaces. The server will be highly 
       modular and reuse solutions from other projects (Tyrex, Cocoon etc).</li>
    <li>secure and multi-threaded design:  based on the technology developed for
       the Apache JServ servlet engine, Apache James has a careful, 
       security-oriented, full multi-threaded design, to allow performance, 
       scalability and mission-critical use.</li>
    <li>anything else you may want if you help us writing it :-)</li>
    </ul>

<h1 align="center">Mail Servlet API Extentions</h1>

<p align="center">by Stefano Mazzocchi, Pierpaolo Fumagalli</p>

<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Servlet are a very powerful yet simple API inteface to allow users and
  developers to enhance the behavior of their servers. Currently, only HTTPServlets were
  designed to extend the abstract request/response framework designed by the generic
  javax.servlet package. With this proposal, our intention is to show that others types of
  client/server paradigms may be enhanced with the use of appropriate servlet extentions.</p>
  <p align="left">Since most of the internet traffic is generated by web and mail, we
  thought appropriate to concentrate our effort on the most used technology ever on the
  internet: the electronic mail. Even if complete and powerful solutions already exist, the
  HTTP servlet experience showed how powerful and easy to use Java servlets are compared to
  other solutions. Mail servlets go in this direction, willing to change the mail processing
  on the server side, allowing easy customization and creation of complex mail systems on
  top of mail servlet engines without requiring specific knowledge of underlying protocols
  or other complex technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left">The goals</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Mail servlets are designed to be the mail equivalent of HTTP servlets for
  the web: this means that it should be easy for a user/developer to write his own servlets
  to enhance his/her server, like it's done today for web servers. It's true that the medium
  and the purpose of the two systems are different, but our goal was to create a seemless
  integration with existing servlet technology <u>without requiring a single modification</u>
  in the existing (Servlet API 2.1) framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left">The design</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">A generic servlet is a simple container for a request/response handler.
  It's a plugin that processes data coming to a particular server location (abstracted from
  the protocol and server type) thru the ServletRequest object and creates some output and
  sends it to its destination using the ServletResponse object.</p>
  <p align="left">Note: this framework doesn't specify the location of the servlet, the way
  to map a servlet to a particular resource, the way to create the request and response and,
  more important, where to send the response to!</p>
  <p align="left">This is the key to the ability to enhance existing classes and solutions
  without requiring changes in the generic servlet&nbsp; package: while HTTPServlets send
  the reponse back to the requester, MailServlet send the response to the specified mail
  recipients. While HTTPServlets work as bouncing applications, MailServlets work as data
  filters. While HTTPServlets do not copy data coming from the input to the output,
  MailServlets copy untouched data from the input (the mail sent) to the output (the
  processed mail).</p>
  <p align="left">The only thing that is changed by this vision, it the behavior of a
  generic servlet that is left unspecified. We suggest, as a precaution, to remove any
  generic servlet implementation from the API (nobody uses it directly, anyway) and to state
  it's unspecified behavior in the Servlet interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">In current servlet technology framework, both users and developers are
  biased by the fact that there is no alternative from the HTTPServlet. Even GenericServlet
  is seen like an example, rather than a usable class and package separation is not
  understood nor appreciated. MailServlets (and other servlets types we are working on such
  as VoiceServlets for the Apache Java Answering Machine (J.A.M.) Project) may enhance the
  platform and give servlet users the ability to understand the general idea behind servlets
  and allow them to easily move from one servlet-enable server platform (web) to another
  (mail) with very little effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left">A possible implementation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Mail servlets do not specify how they are mapped and accessed by the
  clients. A possible implementation (that will be used in Apache James) is the mapping of
  virtual mailboxes to a specified mail servlet.</p>
  <p align="left">An example may clarify the picture.</p>
  <p align="left">Let us suppose we want to create a mailing list in a mailservlet-enable
  mail system. Our mail server is listening on the SMTP port on the host <u>java.apache.org</u>.
  We want the address <u>james-dev@java.apache.org</u> to be the Apache James development
  mailing list.</p>
  <p align="left">Let's write the MailingListServlet as follows (note that since we are not
  allowed to use the <u>javax</u> package, we will use <u>org.apache</u> until JavaSoft
  incorporates them officially into the servlet API framework, if this ever happens)</p>

  </div><p align="left">Once this mail servlet is written and compiled, it can be mapped to
  the <u>james-dev</u> mailbox of the mail server using the appropriate configurations and
  creating the appropriate database tables in the JDBC connected database used by this
  servlet.</p>
  <p align="left">As you see, a powerful and highly flexible mailing list system can be
  created with just a few lines of work and can be ported on any mail-servlet enabled mail
  server.</p>

<h3 align="left">A detailed look at the proposal</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The javadoc generated documents for the proposal may be found <a
  href="../javadoc/index.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">A package containing the source code may be found <a
  href="http://java.apache.org/james/mail_servlets_working_draft.zip">here</a>. You may not
  redistribute, modify or use these classes in any form whatsoever without explicit
  permissions from the authors. The source code are intended to be just a review and a
  working draft and will be subjected to changes in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Future directions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the <a href="http://java.apache.org/">Java Apache Project</a> goals is to create
  a family of enterprise servers using pure Java technologies. Apache JServ, Apache James,
  Apache Jam will try to share common code and resources as well as to propose common
  solutions such as servlet extentions.</p>
  <p>This mail servlet specification is currently just a working draft and will be subjected
  to changes directly by JavaSoft, by other servlet group interests or by the Apache James
  development team before it's definately standardized by inclusion in the JavaSoft Servlet
  API specifications. In case this cannot happen, the &quot;org.apache.servlet.mail&quot;
  package will be ruled by the Apache James development team (even if we don't wish this to
  happen).</p>
  <p>The authors would like to thanks James Duncan Davidson (JavaSoft Servlet API lead) for
  reviewing this proposal and for the work he is doing to make the servlet platform a truly
  open one.</p>

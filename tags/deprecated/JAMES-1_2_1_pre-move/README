  What is it?
  -----------

  The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure 
  Java server application designed to be a complete, portable and powerful
  enterprise mail engine solution based on currently available open protocols 
  (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP etc).

  Development Status for JAMES 1.2.1
  ----------------------------------
  
  SMTP Server: Stable 
  POP3 Server: Beta 
  
  Current Feature
  ----------------

  These are some JAMES features:
  
    o  complete portability:  Apache James is a 100% pure Java(tm) application
       based on the Java 2 platform and the JavaMail 1.1 API.
       
    o  protocol abstraction:  unlike other mail engines, protocols are seen only
       like "communication languages" ruling communications between clients and
       the server. Apache James is not be tied to any particular protocol but
       follow an abstracted server design (almost like JavaMail did on the
       client side)
       
    o  complete solution:  the mail system is able to handle both mail
       transport and storage in a single server application. Apache James
       works alone without the need for any other server or solution.
       
    o  mailet support:  Apache James supports the Apache Mailet API. A Mailet
       is a discrete piece of mail-processing logic which is incorporated into
       a Mailet-compliant mail-server's processing. This easy-to-write,
       easy-to-use pattern allows developers to build powerful customized mail
       systems. Examples of the services a Mailet might provide include: a
       mail-to-fax or mail-to-phone transformer, a filter, a language
       translator, a mailing list manager, etc.
       Several Mailets are included in the JAMES distribution (see
       docs/Configuration.html).
    
    o  resource abstraction:  like protocols, resources are abstracted and,
       accessed through defined interfaces (JavaMail for transport, JDBC for
       storage in RDBMS's, Apache Mailet API), the server is highly modular
       and can reuse solutions from other projects or applications.  
       
    o  secure and multi-threaded design:  based on the technology developed for
       the Apache JServ servlet engine, Apache James has a careful, 
       security-oriented, full multi-threaded design, to allow performance, 
       scalability and mission-critical use.
       
    o  Currently JAMES support SMTP, POP3 and a simple remote administration
       facility.
       

  Planned Features
  ----------------

    o  IMAP support.
    
    o  IMAP server side filtering.

    o  Download remote inbox to your local inbox.
    
    o  More powerful remote admin protocol and tool.
    
    o  Extended set of Mailet to easily support most mail system request.
    
    o  anything else you may want if you help us writing it :-)
       

  Requirements
  ------------

  - JAMES.jar (of course).
  - mailet.jar
  - javax package (activation.jar, mail.jar)
  - Avalon server framework including:
      Avalon.jar
      AvalonAware.jar
      Loader.jar
      Xerces.jar (or any other SAX capable XML Parser).
  - dnsjava.jar
  - town.jar (optional - for RDBMS storage)

  JAMES distribution includes all of the above.
  
  To recompile James from sources you should use org.apache.tools.ant and its 
  needed packages (ant.jar, javac.jar, xml.jar).

  Up and working...
  -----------------

Step 0: building. (only necessary for daily snapshots)

    If you have downloaded a regular distribution, you do not need to
    build James.  Proceed directory to Step 1.
    
    If you have downloaded a daily snapshot, you need to build a
    distribution.  James uses ant (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/) to
    compile and package its distribution.  Once you have installed ant,
    extracted the snapshot to your favorite folder, cd to that folder
    and run the "dist" task by calling "ant dist".  This will create the
    distribution in the "./dist" folder as well as create .tgz and .zip
    copies of this folder.  This "./dist" folder is the distribution
    folder used in Step 1 and beyond.  You may either cd to ./dist, or
    you may copy and rename the dist folder to your new favorite folder.
    
Step 1: installation.

    Download distibution. Extract all files in your favorite folder.
    
Step 2: configuration.

    Read the short and snappy documentation at docs/index.html for a proper
    overview of configuring the system.

Summary (for impatient people)
   
    M$ users should just run /bin/run.bat. Unix users will find run.sh
    under the same folder. A JVM must be in the path.
    Running [run* -help] will provide a simple command line help.	

    Most UNIX systems require superuser privileges to open sockets below 1024,
    which includes the IANA-standard SMTP (on port 25) and POP3 (on port 110).
    These default ports can be changed in the conf.xml file. (Obviously, you
    would then need to reconfigure your clients. This may not be an option if
    you want to receive mail from external mailservers.)

    The Avalon framework will unpack the neccessay configuration files and wait
    for you to configure them. For basic use, you only need to set two items
    in the JAMES.conf.xml file: a root password for the remote administration
    facility and the IP address of a DNS server. Once you have edited the
    configuration files, press 'Enter' on the terminal where Avalon is waiting.
    
Step 4: kickstart.

    Once started you'll see a message saying Avalon is running. This means that
    Avalon has loaded JAMES and every other needed Block (see /logs/avalon.log)
    and is now waiting for a socket request. 
    Since at the beginning James is empty, it will not have any local users
    registered.
    To register a local user open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555,
    log in as root ("root[enter]  <password-you-set-in-conf.xml>[enter]") and
    type "help" for a list of available commands in the "JAMES remote
    administrator tool". It is really a basic set but should allow you to test
    installation.
    
    Once you have some local users registered, try sending mail to one of them
    @localhost with SMTP (port 25) (assuming you have not changed the default
    server names in the conf.xml file). You'll see the mail appear under
    ../var/mail/localinbox/[user].
    Try now to retrieve that mail using POP3 (port 110).
    Trace out JAMES actions in /logs/*info.log.
    Action that will be taken by JAMES on incoming mail are configurated in
    the mailet pipe line (/conf/james.conf.xml). Look at it if you want to
    understand what's happening.
  
  Good luck :)

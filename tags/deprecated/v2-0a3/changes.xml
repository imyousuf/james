<release version="2.0a3" date="20-April-2002">
  <action dev="SK" type="code">
    FileRepository should no longer produce 0-byte files.  It checks that the source is different than the target, or confirm it is in memory before saving to disk.
  </action>
  <action dev="SK" type="update">
    Removed check that connection is not closed before returning it.  The pooler is already confirming the connection was open before putting it in the pool, so this was a big unnecessary performance drain.

  </action>

  <action dev="SK" type="code">
    Support &lt;gatewayPort&gt; setting on RemoteDelivery to send all messages to a non-port 25 SMTP server.  Only makes sense when &lt;gateway&gt; is also set.

<section name="Matchers">

<p>James provides a number of implemented Matchers for use by James administrators in their 
configurations.  These are primarily matchers that members of the James developer or user 
communities have found useful in their own configurations.  A description of how to configure 
Matchers and use them in the James SpoolManager can be found <a href="spoolmanager_configuration_2_1.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Configuration string: None.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="CommandForListserv">

commands.  It will match any email addressed to the list server host, as well as any email that is addressed
to a user named &lt;prefix&gt;-on or &lt;prefix&gt;-off on any host.  Only those matching recipients will be returned.</p>

</subsection>
<subsection name="FetchedFrom">

<h1 align="center">Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server</h1>

<h3 align="center">a.k.a. Apache James </h3>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure Java server
  application designed to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution based
  on currently available open protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Development Status</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apache James is currently under development. There is no working distribution or
  anything usable, yet. So, don't ask. This server will be heavily based on shared packages
  used by every server application developed by the Java Apache Project and we are currently
  trying to get those shared packages done (log system, XML configurations, abstract servlet
  engine, abstract protocol handler, etc...) before start coding the server itself which
  should &quot;glue&quot; together these packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are some of the planned features:<ul>
    <li>complete portability: Apache James will be a 100% pure Java applicationbased on the Java
      2 platform and on to of JavaMail extentions.</li>
    <li>protocol abstraction: unlike other mail engines, protocols are seen only like
      &quot;communication languages&quot; ruling comunications between clients and the server.
      Apache James will not be tied to any particular protocol but will follow an abstracted
      server design (almost like JavaMail did on the client side)</li>
    <li>complete solution: the mail system will be able to handle both mail transport and
      storage in a single server application. Apache James will work alone without the need or
      any other server or solution.</li>
    <li>servlet support: Apache James will be the first ever mail server with MailServlet
      support. The Java Apache Project has submitted for review a proposal to enhance the
      Servlet platform to support other kinds of servers and servlet systems. Apache James will
      allow users and developers to write powerful mail system enhancements using the
      MailServlet framework we designed.</li>
    <li>resource abstraction: like protocols, resources will be abstracted and, working thru
      defined interfaces (JavaMail for transport, JDBC for storage, servlet engine abstraction
      for servlets), the server will be highly <br>
      modular and reuse solutions from other projects or applications.</li>
    <li>secure and multi-threaded design: based on the technology developed for the Apache JServ
      servlet engine, Apache James will have a careful, security-oriented, full multi-threaded
      design, to allow performance, scalability and mission-critical use.</li>
    <li>anything else you may want if you help us writing it :-)</li>
  </ul>

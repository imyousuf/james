  <title>James 3.0 - Installation</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Requirements">

  <subsection name="Java Virtual Machine">
  
    <p>James requires a Java Runtime Environment. Java version 1.5 or higher is required to run the 
       James application. The exact JREs available depend on the platform. In addition, the environment variable JAVA_HOME should be set to
       the JRE home directory before running James.</p>
    
    <p>James 3.0 has been successfully tested on OpenJDK, Sun JDK and IBM JDK</p>
  
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="User Privileges">
    
    <p>On Linux/Unix platforms, root access will be required to run James (access to ports 
       below 1024 is generally restricted to the root user).  As SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 
       need to open server sockets on such ports in standard configurations, 
       James requires root access.</p>
    
    <p>On Windows platforms, you also need to run James as Administrator privilege.</p>
  
  </subsection>
    
  <subsection name="Libc6">
    
    <p>On Linux, to run the startup/shutdown script via the 'james' command, you also need <code>libc6</code> 
        (on Ubuntu for example: <code>sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libc6-dev-i386</code>).</p>
        
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="System Resources">
    
    <p>Obviously James also requires sufficient disk space, processor power, and network bandwidth.  But, 
       other than what's been discussed here, it has no additional special requirements.</p>
    
    <p>James is configured to run with 512 MB RAM available, but may need more or less depending on the load.</p>
  
  </subsection>
  
  </section>
  
  <section name="Install Step by Step">
  
  <subsection name="Step 1: Download James"> 
  
    <p>Obtain the full James binary (or source) distribution from 
       the <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">James 
       release mirrors</a>.</p>
      
    <p>If you have downloaded a binary distribution, you do not need to build James. 
      Proceed directly to Step 2.</p>
    
    <p>If you have downloaded a source package, process first to 
       the <a href="dev-build.html">build</a> and come back to Step 2.</p>
  
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="Step 2: Deploy James">
  
    <p>Unpack the archive into your James installation directory.</p>
  
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="Step 3: Configure James">
  <!-- 
      <div class="ui-widget">
        <div class="ui-state-error ui-corner-all" style="padding: 0 .7em;"> 
          <p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert" style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;"></span> 
          <strong>Preliminary step for JMX on Windows: </strong>
          to let windows start with JMX username/password enabled, 
          you need to modify the security settings for the JMX files (./conf/jmx.password and ./conf/jmx.access) 
          like described here:
          <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/security-windows.html">
          http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/security-windows.html</a>
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>
  -->
    <p>After unpacking the binary, the next step is to adjust the initial configuration.  
       The configuration files reside in the ./conf and ./conf/META-INF folders.</p>
    
    <p>The out of the box configuration makes certain assumptions and has some default 
       values that are unlikely to be appropriate for real-world servers. 
       There are a few issues that should be addressed immediately upon installation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RemoteManager Administrator Account - Before the RemoteManager service can be used to add users to this server 
            installation an administrator account must be created - <a href="config-remotemanager.html">read more</a>.</li>
        <li>Virtual Hosting - Out of the box, James is not configure to manage more than one domain
            If you need James to server multiple domains, you need to enable virtual hosting
             - <a href="config-remotemanager.html">read more</a>. If you want to configure you domains
             in a database rather that in a static XML file, you need to use the JPADomainList
              - <a href="config-domainlist.html">read more</a></li>
        <li>Postmaster Address - Change according to your need - <a href="config-serverwide.html">read more</a>.</li>
        <li>Most UNIX systems require superuser privileges to open sockets below 1024,
            which includes the IANA-standard SMTP (on port 25), POP3 (on port 110) and IMAP4 (on port 143).
            These default ports can be changed in the conf file 
            (read for <a href="config-pop3.html">pop3</a>, <a href="config-smtp.html">smtp</a> 
            and <a href="config-imap4.html">imap4</a>. Obviously, you
            would then need to reconfigure your clients. This may not be an option if
            you want to receive mail from external mailservers.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to adjusting these parameters, you may wish to consult the documentation for a discussion of
       all other configurations.  A list of such configurations, as well as the steps necessary to configure them, can
       be found <a href="config.html">here</a>.</p>
    
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="Step 4: Start James">
  
    <p>Go to the bin subdirectory of the installation directory and run <code>$ ./james start</code>.</p>
      
    <p>Running <code>$ ./james help</code> help will provide the list of commands you can invoke. </p>
    
    <p>Once started, you'll see in the log file (./logs/james-server.log) that 
       James is running. This means that Spring has loaded James and is now waiting for a request.</p>
  
  </subsection>
    
  <subsection name="Step 5: Create Domains and Users">
  
    <p>Finally, after launch, it will be necessary to create user accounts 
       before the James server will be fully operational. Instructions on creating user accounts can be found 
       <a href="manage-users.html">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Since at the beginning James is empty, it will not have any local users
       registered.</p>
       
    <p>To register a local user open a telnet session with localhost on port 4555,
       log in as root ("root[enter]  &lt;password-you-set-in-remotemanager.xml&gt;[enter]") and
       type "help" for a list of available commands in the "JAMES remote
       administrator tool". It is really a basic set but should allow you to test
       installation.</p>
        
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection name="Step 6: Test James">

    <p>Once you have some local users registered, try sending mail to one of them
        with SMTP (port 25).</p>
  
<source>
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 25

    <p>Try now to retrieve that mail using POP3 (port 110) or IMAP (port 143).</p>
    
    <p>Trace out James actions in ./logs/james-server.log.</p>
    
    <p>Actions that will be taken by James on incoming mail are configured in
       the mailet pipe line (./conf/mailetcontainer.xml). Look at it if you want to
       understand what's happening.</p>
